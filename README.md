# CNC-2D-Plotting-Machine
Utilizes stepper and servo motors controlled by an Arduino Uno and CNC shield to precisely maneuver the plotting head along the X and Y axes. It employs GRBL firmware for motor control, with design creation facilitated by software like Inkscape, and G-code transmission managed by UGS, enabling precise and automated plotting on a designated surface.
